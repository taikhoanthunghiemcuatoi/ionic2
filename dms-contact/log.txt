Installing "cordova-plugin-file" for android
Dependent plugin "cordova-plugin-compat" already installed on android.
The Android Persistent storage location now defaults to "Internal". Please check this plugin's README to see if your application needs any changes in its config.xml.
If this is a new application no changes are required.
If this is an update to an existing application that did not specify an "AndroidPersistentFileLocation" you may need to add:
      "<preference name="AndroidPersistentFileLocation" value="Compatibility" />"
to config.xml in order for the application to find previously stored files.
